# performance-programming
Implemented optimization techniques to speed up the performance of my mandelbrot. Optimization techniques include unrolling, SIMD instructions to perform four operations in parallel, and OpenMD to parallelize computation.
Using these techniques I was able to acheive a 14x speed up in my code!
